# algorithm
## personal practice
### there is a sort of some python coding,which based on python2
### and if there are some wrong in coding and english usage you can send email to fuwenbo95@gmail.com.

**********************************
	the selectSort is the first coding in the folder
	the logical construction as follow:
	firstly,outside iteration is the total iteration numbers
	example:
		we have five numbers,and we want to sort them in a birth order
		and we should have to sort 4 times(numbers-1)
	secondly,each small number put in the front(Warning: the front location depend on the iteration if you have choosen two 	small numbers and the following loop about the smallest index is (3-1))
	lastly,the coding is static and you should define an array of a personally.
	the source of coding named selectSearch.py
